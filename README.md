# SSID-Finder
Discover all Access Points you are able to pick up<br />
# Information
This is only tested on Windows, if you have any other Operating System this may not work for you.<br />
# Installation
This is made in Python, so you must have the Python language installed.<br />
To use SSID-Finder simply follow the instructions below:<br />
<br />
Install the needed package(s)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, run main.py
```
python main.py
```
Based on your Python configuration, it may be Python3 or your latest version in the command.
NOTE: You need to have the WiFi viewer thing open, so you can actually discover the access points and get the BSSID's, or else it will only show the one you are connected too<br />
Simply just act like you are going to connect to a network, and the list shows up, keep that open.
